# Resource_Allocation


Developer â€“ Knowledge required : SQL or Mongo DB and Python or C# or Node.JS and WebServices/Rest API, JSON, Data Structures and Design Patterns. 
Resource Skill matching Algorithm 
Situation: 
A manager is tasked with scheduling resources based on their skills and their availability tostaff projects. Each project needs to be staffed based on tasks, required skills and date schedules. 
Assume a list of Projects. For each project, compile a list of tasks with a schedule date (fromand to) and the skills required for the task. 
Also assume a list of resources with skills and dates available. 
Write an algorithm to find resources that will match the tasks, skills and the available dates for a given project. 
Expected output: 
1. Sequence/Interaction Diagram. 
2. Database Design 
3. Sample Data 
4. Working Web API/Rest Services code in the language of your choice. What will be evaluated: 
1. Design correctness 
2. Usage of Design patterns 
3. Logging and Exception handling 
4. Code Structure
